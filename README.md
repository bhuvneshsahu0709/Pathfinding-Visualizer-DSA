# Pathfinding Visualizer (DSA Project)

A visual tool for understanding pathfinding algorithms in action, built as part of a Data Structures & Algorithms coursework.

## Features
- Interactive grid where you can:
  - Set **start** and **end** nodes
  - Draw or remove **walls**
  - Visualize algorithm exploration and shortest path tracing
- Supports multiple algorithms:
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  - Breadth‑First Search (BFS)
  - Depth‑First Search (DFS)

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bhuvneshsahu0709/Pathfinding-Visualizer-DSA.git
    cd Pathfinding-Visualizer-DSA
    ```

2. **Open locally**
    - For static HTML/JS project: open `index.html` in your browser.

## Live Demo
Once deployed via GitHub Pages, your project will be accessible at:
`https://bhuvneshsahu0709.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer-DSA/`

## Future Enhancements
- More algorithms (A*, Greedy, Bellman-Ford, etc.)
- Maze generation
- Speed controls, weighted nodes, animations, etc.

## About
A DSA course project to help visualize how pathfinding algorithms traverse grids to find paths.
